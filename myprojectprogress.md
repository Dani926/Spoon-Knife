I am currently not sure what project I would like to work on. I have a few ideas for open source software I could start from scratch, though I think I am more interested in working on an already established project. I am also in RCOS and there are a few projects that were pitched there that I am interested in potentially working on for this class. If I start a project from scratch I would most likely organize it as a common repository since the group working on it would likely be small and not in need of a bless repository organization. Of course if I join an already existing project then I will use whatever organization is already implemented.
